This project handles the content scraping of the text from [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) and saves it
to a Firebase Real Time Database. 

Currently the project is being updated to save data to the Firebase Cloud Firestore, since it seems Google may be on their way
to slowly depracating the real time database.

Everything in the folder `rtdb` is for the real-time database. Everything in the folder `firestore` will be for the cloud firestore database.

The app that uses this content is on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ah.xiny3&hl=en).

Please note: all the content from the website belongs to the authors and has not been modified in any way. All of this has been done with permission from the original author/owner of Learn X in Y Minutes.
